# DigitalWhiteboard

The primary goal of this project is to design a mobile computer vision application that converts handwritten content on ordinary paper into a digital whiteboard. The system will operate in real-time and low computational cost. There are two main areas of focus:

- Removal of foreground objects and shadows, such as hands and pencils, to ensure the digitized content is clean and focused.
- Compressing a deep learning model to meet the requirements of latency and mobile resources, enabling smooth and efficient operation on mobile devices.

## Project Overview

**Background:** During this COVID-19 period, work-from-home is a new situation for everyone of us.
We all have been and are currently going through online teaching and learning experiences. As you
may notice that it is hard to use the MS Teams Whiteboard function for presentation and discussion
in both lectures and exams. Writing on paper is the most convenient and fastest manner to record
and show our ideas in everyday life. Although we can use an iPad and its pencils to solve such a
difficulty, it is expensive and inconvenient to carry. Therefore, an optimal solution is to develop a
mobile application that can digitize ordinary handwriting and share it with remote collaborators in
real time. This solution is both cost-effective and convenient with possible application to teaching
in remote areas as well.

## Features

The key features of the Mobile Whiteboard App would include:

- Handwriting Digitization: The app will be able to convert ordinary handwriting on paper into digital format, allowing users to easily share and collaborate on their handwritten content remotely.
- Real-time Sharing: The app will enable real-time sharing of digitized content with remote collaborators. This feature will facilitate seamless collaboration and interaction during lectures, discussions, or group projects.
- Foreground Object and Shadow Removal: The app will automatically remove foreground objects and shadows, such as hands and pencils, from the digitized content. This ensures that the resulting digital whiteboard is clean and focused, enhancing readability and clarity.
- Low Latency and Computational Cost: The app will be designed to work in real-time with low latency, providing a smooth and responsive experience for users. It will also be optimized to minimize computational resource requirements, allowing it to run efficiently on mobile devices.
-Deep Learning Model Compression: To meet the requirements of mobile resources, the app will incorporate techniques to compress the deep learning model used for handwriting digitization. This will enable the app to operate effectively on mobile devices without compromising performance.
-Integration with Computer Vision Tools: The app will leverage popular computer vision tools, such as OpenCV, to enhance its functionality and optimize the digitization process. This integration will provide users with a robust and reliable solution for converting handwritten content to a digital whiteboard.

By incorporating these key features, the Mobile Whiteboard App aims to provide a cost-effective and convenient solution for digitizing ordinary handwriting and facilitating remote collaboration in real-time.
